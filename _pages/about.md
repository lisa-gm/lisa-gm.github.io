I am Postdoctoral fellow at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/) in the Bayesian Computational Statistics and Modeling Group. My research interests lie in fusing statistical learning techniques with methods from high-performance computing. I'm particularly interested in Bayesian methods, probabilistic programming and spatio-temporal modeling as well as sparse and (block)-dense direct solvers.

I hold a PhD in Computational Science from [Università della Svizzera italiana](https://www.usi.ch/en) and a Master's degree in Mathematics from [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html).
